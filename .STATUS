# Known Issues

## StatusLine Bug in Claude Code v2.0.70
**Status:** Documented (STATUSLINE-BUG.md)
**Impact:** Low (does not affect aiterm functionality)
**Description:** Claude Code v2.0.70 (current brew version) does not pass JSON to statusLine scripts via stdin. The statusline-p10k.sh script is correctly implemented but cannot receive session data from Claude Code.
**Workaround:** None until Claude Code updates
**Note:** This bug was discovered during v0.1.0-dev release prep. The statusLine script itself is production-ready and will work once Claude Code is updated.

# Next Actions
1. ✅ Tag created: v0.1.0-dev (merged to main and dev)
2. Create GitHub release with STATUSLINE-BUG.md noted in known issues
3. v0.2.0: Hook management, MCP integration, statusLine builder tool
