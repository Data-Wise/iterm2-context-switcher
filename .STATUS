# Known Issues

## StatusLine Bug in Claude Code v2.0.70
**Status:** Documented (STATUSLINE-BUG.md)
**Impact:** Low (does not affect aiterm functionality)
**Description:** Claude Code v2.0.70 (current brew version) does not pass JSON to statusLine scripts via stdin. The statusline-p10k.sh script is correctly implemented but cannot receive session data from Claude Code.
**Workaround:** None until Claude Code updates
**Note:** This bug was discovered during v0.1.0-dev release prep. The statusLine script itself is production-ready and will work once Claude Code is updated.

# ✅ Just Completed (Dec 17)
- Created comprehensive Claude Code CLI tutorial (3,266 lines, 16 sections)
- Added ADHD-friendly workflows, tips, and plugin vetting guide
- Deployed site to GitHub Pages with Gemini CLI docs
- Tagged v0.1.0-dev release
- Fixed broken anchors in tutorial

# 🎯 Next Action
**Choose one:**
- **A)** Test aiterm CLI features daily (dogfooding) 🟢
- **B)** Implement full `aiterm init` wizard (v0.1.1)
- **C)** Add more `aiterm doctor` diagnostics

# Future Actions
1. Create GitHub release with STATUSLINE-BUG.md noted in known issues
2. v0.2.0: Hook management, MCP integration, statusLine builder tool
